# Run Skeleton Contract

- `control.json` (engine-required)
- `events.ndjson` (engine-required; can start empty)
- `PRD.md`

Optional:

- `loop_state.json` (optional control plane for role gating)
- `VISION.md` (optional high-level intent for review/steering)
- Local `agents.md` files (in directories that were edited, only if gotchas/invariants/workflows were discovered that are worth capturing)
